//! VM creation and lifecycle management.
//!
//! This module provides the core abstractions for creating and managing microVMs:
//! - [`VmConfig`]: Configuration for a VM instance
//! - [`VmHandle`]: Trait for controlling a running VM
//! - [`VmBackend`]: Trait for VM backend implementations (e.g., libkrun)
